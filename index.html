                <p>Endlessly caring. Iâ€™ve witness you Extend your compassion with people you love, people youâ€™re just acquainted with, and Even people who have disrupted the peace in your heart. You choose kindness over pettiness everytime to everyone. Though, Iâ€™m very grateful to be one of the few people who get to hear your pettiness comments bc theyâ€™re actual GOLD LMAO. Nonetheless, it boggles my mind someone can be so caring and yet so</p>

                <p>Naturally beautiful. My GAWD GIRL. How can someone be THAT good looking but also have high quality personality traits. I also knew youâ€™d have a phenomenal resting heart rate. Youâ€™re literally naturally amazing from the inside out. Except the outside is so effortless, the inside I see you putting that work in the gym....which brings me to my next letter</p>

                <p>Adored by the people around you. I could literally write books about how phenomenal of a person you are. You make life so much fun, you fill it with laughs and loves.

I love you so much sis.</p>
